- 👋 Hi, I’m @stutzgefahr
- 👀 I’m interested in....    <meep-merp-beeeeep> TX Football...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...  Yeah, sure.   Need to get a handle on github and messing around.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...    Uh, nothing wanted/needed from others.    Let me be, and I'll get past the learning curve soon enough.
- 📫 How to reach me ...    Why do you need to reach me?      Don't need anyone reaching or pinging me to make this some sort of lame facebook experience.
